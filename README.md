## Summary

The Code Quiz is an html / javaScript website in which it lets the user interact with.  Code Quiz like previously said, it uses HTML but most of the coding using JavaScript to make the website be more interactive rather being static.

The first thing that I stated with the code was calling up the questions, choices and answers so the user can see start interact with;

Then I compared the choices with the answers in which I called it as _"a"_ and I basically said if you have it right you get points and the timer doesn't change and else you dont get points plus the penalty in which you get time deducted. and when finishing the game it would create a local file with the scores and send it to the highScore.html so it could display it.

As you would see in this image, it displays the high score in the website but the information is saved in your local storage of your computer.

Depending on the code, you can have infite number of questions but for the purpose of this challenge, we only have 4 questions in it.

Once finishing the challenge youll be prompt to write your name or initial so the high score could be displayed on the highScore.html
